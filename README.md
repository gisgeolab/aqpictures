# AQpictures
---
This repository provides a **scientific toolkit** (an open repository with analysis-ready data, method source code, scripts, and documentation) supporting the implementation, testing, and benchmarking of **image-based methods for particulate matter (PM) estimation** from the *AQpictures* project, developed within the [**ISPRS Scientific Initiatives 2025**](https://www.isprs.org/society/si/default.aspx) framework.

The goal of the repository is to support **replicability, comparison, and reuse** of image-based air quality estimation methods by providing:
- analysis-ready example datasets,
- documented code notebooks implementing selected methods.

The repository is intended for **research and educational purposes** and complements the methodological description provided in the project documentation.

## Repository structure
