**Air quality from pictures:** benchmarking and assessment of image-based methods for particulate matter estimation
---
This repository provides a **scientific toolkit** (an open repository with analysis-ready data, method source code, scripts, and documentation) supporting the implementation, testing, and benchmarking of **image-based methods for particulate matter (PM) estimation** from the *AQpictures* project, developed within the [**ISPRS Scientific Initiatives 2025**](https://www.isprs.org/society/si/default.aspx) framework.

The goal of the repository is to support **replicability, comparison, and reuse** of image-based air quality estimation methods by providing:
- analysis-ready example datasets,
- documented code notebooks implementing selected methods.

The repository is intended for **research and educational purposes** and complements the methodological description provided in the project documentation.

## Repository structure

```
aqpictures/
│
├── code/ # Jupyter notebooks and scripts implementing image-based PM estimation methods
├── data/ # Sample datasets used for method testing and benchmarking
└── references/ # Reference scientific literature list and dissemination material
```

### Additional branch

The [`pm25-benchmark_Q_Tuo`](https://github.com/gisgeolab/aqpictures/tree/pm25-benchmark_Q_Tuo) branch contains an extended workflow developed by **Qingxuan Tuo** as part of a MSc thesis project, focused on **image-based PM2.5 estimation from fixed webcam imagery**, multi-source environmental data integration, and the implementation and comparison of different modelling strategies.

## How to use this repository

1. Start from the `code/` folder to explore the implemented workflows and notebooks.
2. Use the `data/` folder to access the sample datasets considered in the project.
3. Follow notebook-level documentation for details on data preparation, method assumptions, and outputs.
