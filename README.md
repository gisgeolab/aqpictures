# AQpictures
<!-- 
This repository provides a toolkit including **sample data and open-source code** supporting the implementation, testing, and benchmarking of **image-based methods for particulate matter (PM) estimation**, as described in the *AQpictures* project developed within the **ISPRS Scientific Initiatives 2025** framework.

The goal of the repository is to support **replicability, comparison, and reuse** of image-based air quality estimation methods by providing:
- analysis-ready example datasets,
- documented code notebooks implementing selected methods,
- a transparent folder structure facilitating method adaptation to other geographic contexts.

The repository is intended for **research and educational purposes** and complements the methodological description provided in the project documentation.

## Repository structure

aqpictures/
│
├── code/ # Jupyter notebooks and scripts implementing image-based PM estimation methods
├── data/ # Sample datasets used for method testing and benchmarking
├── references / # Reference scientific literature list (TBD)

## How to use this repository

1. Start from the `code/` folder to explore the implemented workflows and notebooks.
2. Use the `data/` folder to access the sample datasets required to run the examples.
3. Follow notebook-level documentation for details on data preparation, method assumptions, and outputs.
